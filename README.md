# Hi, I’m Uchechi 

I’m a backend-focused software engineer with 5+ years of industry experience, currently transitioning from hands-on software development into system architecture and technical leadership.

I have spent most of my career building and maintaining production systems at scale. Today, my focus is shifting toward designing resilient, scalable architectures and making high-level technical decisions that prevent problems before they reach production.

---

## What I’ve been doing
- Building backend services and APIs for high-traffic systems  
- Solving production issues in fintech, martech, and telecom environments  
- Optimizing performance for systems handling millions of daily operations  
- Working within distributed systems and service-oriented architectures  

This foundation as a developer is what now drives my interest in **architecture-level thinking**.

---

## What I’m transitioning into
I’m intentionally moving beyond reactive development toward proactive system design. My current focus areas include:

- Designing scalable and fault-tolerant system architectures  
- Breaking down monolithic systems into maintainable microservices  
- Defining service boundaries, data flow, and communication patterns  
- Making informed trade-offs between scalability, reliability, and complexity  

My goal is to evolve into a system architect who can design large, complex systems from the ground up — not just implement individual features.

## Systems I’ve worked on
In professional environments, I’ve contributed to:
- High-throughput URL shortening and analytics systems supporting millions of reads and writes  
- AI-powered audience segmentation and campaign personalization platforms  
- Real-time reporting systems for campaign performance and optimization  
- Migration from monolithic architectures to microservices to reduce single points of failure  
- Backend platforms managing hundreds of millions of records in production  

Due to confidentiality agreements, most professional systems are not publicly available.  
This GitHub contains personal projects, architectural explorations, and learning-focused implementations that reflect how I think about systems.

## Tech stack
**Languages & Frameworks:**  
Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, React  

**Architecture & Infrastructure:**  
AWS, Docker, Kafka, gRPC, Redis, BullMQ  

**Data:**  
PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Relational Databases  

**Core Interests:**  
System Design · Distributed Systems · Scalability · Reliability · Architecture

---

## What I’m actively learning
- Advanced distributed systems design  
- Cloud-native and event-driven architectures  
- Designing for global scale, fault tolerance, and maintainability  

I’m interested in backend engineering, system architecture, and applied engineering challenges where thoughtful design matters.
